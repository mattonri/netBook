# NetBook
NetBook is a networking desktop application built for students at BYU-Idaho, where they can search through records of internships that previous students from the university have had. They can look up contact info of employers, companies, and BYUI alumni either through the search bar or through specified filters. The app then prompts them to make a record of who they reached out to and when.

## Our Purpose
We wanted to make something that would help bridge the gap between students seeking internship opportunities and the employers who have prior experience hiring students from BYU-Idaho. The intent of our software is to make the process of reaching out and then following up more natural.

## Development Environment
The application utilizes SQLite3 for the database. This electron forge was put together using Bootstrap, HTML, JavaScript, and a touch of CSS.

## Challenges
The main obstacles we faced in the development of this program include the process of cleaning the data when putting together our relational database, learning to work in a dynamic environment with JavaScript, and adapting to changes when html structures shifted.

This application was put together by a team of four software engineers in the space of 24 hours.
