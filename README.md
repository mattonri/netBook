# NetBook
NetBook is a networking desktop application built for students at BYU-Idaho, where they can search through records of internships that other students from the university have had. They can look up contact info of employers, companies, and BYUI alumni either through the search bar or through specified filters. The app then prompts them to make a record of who they reached out to and when.

## Our Purpose
We wanted to make something that would help bridge the gap between students seeking internship opportunities and the employers who have prior experience hiring students from BYU-Idaho. The intent of our software is to make the process of reaching out and then following up more natural.


## Development Environment
The application utilizes SQLite for the database. The web site was put together using Bootstrap and HTML.

This application was put together by a team of software engineers in the space of 24 hours.
